# Running with Docker

## Requirements

* Docker must be installed in the machine that will build the images and/or run
  the containers.

## Building the image

* Pull from our [container registry](@API_CONTAINER_REGISTRY@) or...
* Use the provided Dockerfile to build @APP_NAME@ images:
    1. Run `docker build -t {YOUR_IMAGE_NAME} .` from the project folder.
  > No build arguments are required.

## Running containers

* When running a container, you may provide the following environment variables
  via `--env`:
    - `PORT` [optional]:
        - Port where the API is exposed inside the container. Default is 8080.
    - `USE_HTTPS` [optional]:
        - Any non-empty value to try to serve via HTTPS, leave undefined for
          HTTP.
    - `STREAM_TIMEOUT` [optional]:
        - Integer value specifying how many seconds a streaming validation
          should wait for incoming data before being terminated. Defaults to 40.

## Supported tags

- _:stable_: Stable build updated manually.
- <_:hashed_tags_>: Automated builds by our CI pipeline. With the latest
  features uploaded to our repository but lacking
  internal testing.

## Serving with HTTPS
